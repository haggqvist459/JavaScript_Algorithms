Recursion
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. 
Recursion is when a function calls itself. 

If you find yourself breaking down your problem into smaller version of the same problem, recursion is very useful. 

Quick analogy: 
The total number of students in an university. 

Principal says its the total number of students under professor A and professor B. 

Professor A replies their total number of students are the total number of students under Teacher A and Teacher B. 
Professor B replies their total number of students are the total number of students under Teacher C and Teacher D. 

This is the lowest level that the problem can be broken down into. 
The problem has been finding the number of students. But in each level the problem is smaller. 

-------

Every recursive solution needs a base case, a condition to terminate the recursion. 
Recursion might simplify solving a problem but it does not always translate to a faster solution. 
A recursive solution may be far worse compared to an iterative solution.
